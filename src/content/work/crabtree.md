During my time at Crabtree & Evelyn, I had the opportunity to lead and contribute to the development of new skincare and cosmetic products that reflected the brand’s heritage while integrating modern, innovative ingredients and formulations. Working closely with global teams, I spearheaded the creation of several product lines that maintained the brand's commitment to quality and craftsmanship, while also introducing contemporary skincare solutions for a diverse and evolving market.

One of my key achievements was enhancing product formulations by incorporating natural, sustainably sourced ingredients, ensuring that our products met the highest standards of efficacy and environmental responsibility. My role also involved researching emerging trends, which allowed me to introduce fresh concepts that resonated with both loyal customers and new audiences. This fusion of tradition and forward-thinking innovation helped maintain Crabtree & Evelyn’s reputation as a trusted and beloved global skincare brand.
