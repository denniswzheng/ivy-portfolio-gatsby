At Tarte Cosmetics, I played a pivotal role in the development of high-performance, eco-conscious beauty products that align with the brand’s ethos of combining natural ingredients with cutting-edge technology. My focus was on creating innovative formulations that delivered both impactful results and a guilt-free, clean beauty experience.

I collaborated closely with the product development team to bring to life several key launches, from concept through to production. This involved researching sustainable and cruelty-free ingredients, optimizing formulations for performance and longevity, and ensuring products met rigorous safety and efficacy standards. My work at Tarte also included staying ahead of the latest beauty trends, allowing us to consistently release products that appealed to both loyal fans and new consumers looking for clean, effective beauty solutions.

The result was a range of products that not only performed beautifully but also aligned with the growing consumer demand for eco-conscious, high-quality cosmetics, reinforcing Tarte’s position as a leader in the clean beauty movement.
